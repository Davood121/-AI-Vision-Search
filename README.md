## 📖 About The Project

**AI Vision Search** is a next-generation research tool that "sees" your images and finds the truth behind them. Unlike standard reverse image search, it doesn't just look for matching pixels—it understands the *context* using a neural network and performs a deep cognitive search to generate a synthesized report.

> *"Show me a photo, and I'll tell you its story."*

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 👁️ **Neural Vision** | Uses **BLIP (Salesforce)** to generate human-like descriptions of any image. |
| 🧠 **Deep Brain** | An intelligent module that generates multiple technical search queries to dig deeper. |
| 🌐 **Live Synthesis** | Aggregates real-time data from the web to write a "Deep Dive Report" instantly. |
| 🎨 **Premium UI** | A stunning **Glassmorphism** interface with drag-and-drop and smooth animations. |
| 🕵️ **Privacy First** | Runs locally on your machine. Your personal photos never leave your server. |

## 🗺️ Roadmap

We are constantly evolving. Here is what we have built and what's coming next:

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
- [x] Integrate BLIP Image Captioning Model
- [x] Build Flask Backend API
- [x] Implement Basic Web Search (DuckDuckGo)
- [x] Create High-Fidelity Glassmorphism Frontend

### � Phase 2: Intelligence (Current)
- [x] **Deep Search Algorithm**: Fallback logic and multi-query generation.
- [x] **Smart Synthesis**: Summarizing multiple sources into one readable report.
- [x] **Markdown Rendering**: Beautifully formatted output in the UI.

### 🚀 Phase 3: Future Expansion (Coming Soon)
- [ ] **Voice Interaction**: Ask questions about the image with your voice.
- [ ] **History & Export**: Save your research reports as PDF/Markdown.
- [ ] **Object Detection**: Draw a box around specific parts of the image to analyze.
- [ ] **Mobile App**: A React Native version for iOS and Android.
